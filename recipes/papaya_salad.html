       <p>This papaya salad is light and refreshing. I can easily eat a giant bowl of it and be completely satisfied.
        And as an extra bonus, this salad is pretty healthy. I sometimes add extra chiles because I enjoy a lot of heat.
        That's what is great about this recipe, it is easily customized to suit individual tastes.</p>
